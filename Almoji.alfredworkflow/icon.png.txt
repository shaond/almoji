Icon Placeholder

Since we cannot create actual PNG images in this environment, you'll need to add an icon.png file manually.
The icon should be a 256x256 PNG image representing emojis or the Almoji brand.

You can use an emoji character as the icon by taking a screenshot of a large emoji,
or create a custom icon using a tool like Sketch, Figma, or online icon generators.

Recommended: Use the 😊 emoji or 🔍 emoji as the icon.

To create an emoji icon on macOS:
1. Open TextEdit
2. Type a large emoji (⌘+ to increase size)
3. Take a screenshot (⌘+Shift+4, then Space, click window)
4. Resize to 256x256 pixels
5. Save as icon.png in this directory
